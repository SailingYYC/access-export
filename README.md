# access-export
The goal of this project is to create an executable JAR with which you can export and convert MS Access databases to various formats. It uses [Jackcess](http://jackcess.sourceforge.net/) to read mdb and accdb files from MS Access versions 97-2010. In the first step the supported export formats will be SQLite, CSV and SQL statements.
